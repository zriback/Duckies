This week focuses on actually doing the things we have doing through ducky script and through physical duckies. This includes deploying calling card type scripts through 
duckies as well as eventually deploying the meterpreter payload on a victims machine through a ducky.

This week is all about learning ducky script and how to make the physical digispark board that we have do what we want it to do using this simple but powerful language.
