This repository contains many scripts relating to Rubber Duckies / Bad USB deviced.
Some details are included below on all the contents of the various weeks:

Week 1:
  Learning about what a rubber ducky is and how it is used professionally, especially for the purposes of penetration testing.

Week 2:
  Relating to how to prove you were on a system - i.e., drop a file or calling card proving that the system is vulnerable to such attacks where you had access and were able to
  create a file on the victim's machine. Included here is a powershell script that will create multiple files on the desktop of a user.
 
Week 3:
  Relating to reverse shells, why they are better than bind shells, how to set them up using netcat, and how to make a more advances reverse shell through msfvenom
  and meterpreter. In this week there is an example of a attacking linux machine setting up reverse access shells on a victim Ubuntu box and a Windows 10 box.
  
Week 4:
  Finally translating everything we have done into ducky scripts. Now, the goal is to be able to do everything that we have done manually through an actual physical USB rubber
  ducky. This includes the simple calling card powershell script (dropafile.ps1) as well as the more complex task of deploying the payload.exe that is used to established
  a more advanced meterpreter session on a victims computer.
