This week we will learn how to take the ducky scripts we wrote from week4 and translate them so the physical digispark ducky device that we are using will be able to execute them on a hypothetical victim's machine.

This is done using a duck2spark.py file from the public github repository https://github.com/mame82/duck2spark
I did not write this piece of code.

All of the .ino files included in this folder are Arduino sketch files made from the ducky scripts from the week4 folder. These sketches are designed to be uploaded onto the digispark ducky and run on a hypothetical victim's computer.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
These scripts work for my computer - it is possible that even if your computer has the correct OS and correct applications installed that they will still not work because your computer is
not fast enough to keep up with the speed of the keystrokes. A simple fix for this is to add longer delays between the commands.

More details are included in the write up for this week.
