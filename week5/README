This section is about translating the text files containing the raw ducky scripts into arduino sketches (.ino file extension) so they can be put onto the physical ducky through the arduino application. This is done using a public github repository called duck2spark.

NOTE: The duck2spark.py file was not written by me - it was obtained from this public github repository: https://github.com/mame82/duck2spark
However, in this project I used a slightly different version duck2spark_fixed.py that I modified every so slightly. This change is briefly covered in the write up.
