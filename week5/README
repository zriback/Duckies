This week we will learn how to take the ducky scripts we wrote from week4 and translate them so the physical digispark ducky device that we are using will be able to execute them on a hypothetical victim's machine.

This is done using a duck2spark.py file from the public github repository https://github.com/mame82/duck2spark
I did not write this piece of code.

More details are included in the write up for this week.
